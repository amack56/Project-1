Project 1 - Proposal

## Members:

- Mark Campbell
- Alex Mack
- Antonio Guerrero

## Tasks:

- Create repo (all)
- Create project structure (Mark)
- Create user branches (all)
- Test/Play APIs with Python (Antonio)
- Look at scoring structures/what type of leagues we want to backtest (Alex)
- Visualize data & use a new library (Mark)

## Proposal:

We are attempting to use Yahoo Sports API and ESPN API, as well as other resources to scrub the historical data of previous years of fantasy football in order to draw conclusions and present analysis of data.

## Data:

The data sets that we’re looking at now are Yahoo, and ESPN, but we will keep researching and testing different APIs and select which one provides the most accurate and easy data to manage and to both analyze and create a simple dashboard.

## Final Product:

The idea here is to create a dashboard with Panel, that contains PyViz graphs from the data we created and manipulated, firstly extracting the data from an API, then creating a Database with SQL, and manipulating it with Pandas.

Ideally from this data we can better analyze draft strategies and players in order to provide an ‘edge.’ We can look at things like drafting players with high average weekly scores and high std devs vs. players with high scores but low deviations. Additionally, we can implement betting strategies and assess our rate of return and associated financial metrics in order to assess how our ‘system’ works in a real world setting. 

## Research:
- Which new library should we use?
